It encompasses the system&#39;s major components, their relationships, and interactions, along with the principles and guidelines governing them. The role of software architecture is crucial because it shapes the foundation of the system, ensuring it meets both functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance, scalability, security, and maintainability.</p><p>Software architecture can follow different patterns, depending on the system&#39;s requirements and constraints.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>I am only listing the ones that I&#39;ve been dealing with or interact with a couple of times ðŸ˜ƒ</p></div><h2 id="tl-dr" tabindex="-1">TL;DR <a class="header-anchor" href="#tl-dr" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;TL;DR&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Architecture</th><th>Primary Focus</th><th>Communication Style</th><th>Deployment</th><th>Best Use Case</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Monolithic</strong></td><td>Single cohesive application</td><td>Direct function calls</td><td>Single unit</td><td>Small/simple apps, startups</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SOA</strong></td><td>Broad, coarse-grained services</td><td>ESB (SOAP/XML)</td><td>Centralized</td><td>Large enterprises, legacy integration</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Microservices</strong></td><td>Small, fine-grained services</td><td>REST/gRPC or message brokers</td><td>Independent</td><td>Cloud-native, scalable systems</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now, if you are ready to dive in, let&#39;s do it!</p><h2 id="_1-monolithic-architecture-ma" tabindex="-1">1.
