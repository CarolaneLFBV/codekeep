# Behavioral Patterns

*Last Updated: Dec 7, 2024*

Behavioral patterns focus on communication and responsibilities between objects, making interactions more flexible and organized.

I am only listing the ones that I've been dealing with or interact with a couple of times :)

## TL;DR
* `Observer`: Notifies multiple objects of state changes in a central object, great for event-driven systems.
* `State`: Allows an objectâ€™s behavior to change based on its internal state.
* `Template Method`: Defines a skeleton of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to customize parts of it.

## Observer Pattern
### Definition
The `Observer Pattern` establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 
* `Subject` is an object that maintains a list of observers and notifies them of state changes.
* `Observers` are objects that subscribe to the subject to receive updates.

### Flow

* `State Change`: The `Subject`'s state changes (e.g., data is updated).
* `Notification`: The `Subject` notifies all registered `Observers` of the change.
* `Observer Reaction`: Each `Observer` reacts to the notification, which may involve updating the UI or performing some other action.
