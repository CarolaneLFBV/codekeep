# Structural Patterns

*Last Updated: March 23, 2025*

Structural patterns help organize and manage relationships between objects to form larger structures and enhance flexibility and reusability.

:::warning
I am only sharing the patterns I have interacted with!
:::

## TL;DR
* `Adapter`: Makes incompatible interfaces compatible by acting as a translator.
* `Model-View-Controller`: Separates data, interface, and control logic for organized structure.
* `Model-View-ViewModel`: Enhances MVC by adding a ViewModel, which acts as a bridge between Model and View, allowing data binding and cleaner separation of business logic and UI.

## Adapter Pattern
### Definition
The `Adapter Pattern` allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a **middleman (adapter)** that translates between them.

Think about when you are traveling: when you decide to travel to a different continent, it's complicated to use a power outlet! That's where the plug adapter comes in, and helps you to adapt your charger. Same here! 

### Flow
* `Adapter Creation`: The adapter class is created, implementing the interface and methods expected by the client.
* `Adaptation`: The adapter translates or maps requests from the client interface to the adaptee's interface.
* `Usage`: The client can now use the adapter as if it were using the original system or class.

### Example - In Code
```swift
// Target (What the client expects)
protocol LegacyPrinter {
    func printText(_ text: String)
}
```

```swift
// Adaptee (New incompatible class)
class ModernPrinter {
    func printModern(_ content: String) {
        print("üñ®Ô∏è Modern Printer Output: \(content)")
    }
}
```

```swift
// Adpter
class PrinterAdapter: LegacyPrinter {
    private let modernPrinter = ModernPrinter()
    
    func printText(_ text: String) {
        modernPrinter.printModern(text)
    }
}
```

#### Usage
```swift
func sendToPrinter(printer: LegacyPrinter) {
    printer.printText("Hello, Adapter Pattern!")
}
```

## Model-View-Controller (MVC)
### Definition
The `MVC` is an architectural pattern that separates your code into 3 clear responsibilities:
* `Model`: Manages the data and business logic.
* `View`: Handles the UI and what the user sees.
* `Controller`: Acts as the middleman ‚Äî it connects the Model and the View.
The goal here is to separate concerns so the code is easier to manage, test and update.

Think of your MVC as a restaurant:
* Model = The kitchen (prepares the food = data)
* View = The customer‚Äôs table (displays the food)
* Controller = The waiter (connects customer & kitchen)

### Flow
* The `View` receives user input and notifies the `Controller`.
* The `Controller` interacts with the `Model` to get or update data. 
* Once the `Model` is updated of fetched, the `Controller` updates the `View`.

### Example - In Code
```swift
// Model
struct User {
    var name: String
}
```

```swift
// Controller
@Observable
class UserController {
    private(set) var user: User = User(name: "Alice")
    
    func changeUserName(to newName: String) {
        user.name = newName
    }
}
```

```swift
// View
import SwiftUI

struct UserView: View {
    @State private var controller: UserController
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Text("üë§ User Name: \(controller.user.name)")
                .font(.title)
            
            Button("Change Name to Bob") {
                controller.changeUserName(to: "Bob")
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

## Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
### Definition
The `MVVM`  is a modern architectural pattern designed to separate concerns in UI applications.
The goal: Keep your UI logic, business logic, and data model clean and separated.

* The `Model` is similar to MVC, which represents the data and business logic of the application.
* The `View` displays the user interface and binds to properties exposed by the ViewModel.
* The `ViewModel` acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, and exposes data in a way that the View can easily consume.

Let's use our creativity again, and imagine a smart display screen:
* Model = The raw data (like API response or database info)
* ViewModel = The smart brain that formats, transforms, and prepares data for display
* View = The screen ‚Äî shows what the ViewModel gives it and sends back user actions

### Flow
* The `View` binds to properties in the `ViewModel`.
* When the `ViewModel` receives updates from the `Model` or processes user input, it notifies the `View` of changes.
* The `View` updates automatically based on the data bound to the `ViewModel`.

### Example - In Code
```swift
// Model
extension App.Entities {
    struct Category: Identifiable {
        var id: UUID
        var title: String
        var color: Color
        
        init(
            id: UUID = UUID(),
            title: String,
            color: Color,
        ) {
            self.id = id
            self.title = title
            self.color = color
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
// Here in order to interact with the data (SwiftData), I 'm using a repository.
extension App.Repositories {
    struct CategoryRepository: App.Protocols.CategoryDataProviding {

        @MainActor
        static func fetch() async throws -> [CategoryEntity] {
            let categoriesFetch = FetchDescriptor<CategoryResponseEntity>()
            do {
                let data = try getContext().fetch(categoriesFetch)
                return data
                    .convert()
            } catch {
                print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                throw error
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
// ViewModel
extension App.Views.CategoriesList {
    @Observable @MainActor
    final class ViewModel {
        var categories: [App.Entities.Category] = []

        func loadData() async {
            do {
                categories = try await App.Repositories.CategoryRepository.fetch()
            } catch {
                print("Error while loading data, \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
// View
import SwiftUI

extension App.Views {
    struct CategoriesList: View {
        @State private var viewModel = ViewModel()
        
        var body: some View {
            content
                .task {
                    await viewModel.loadData()
                }
                .navigationTitle("categories")
        }
    }
}

private extension App.Views.CategoriesList {
    var content: some View {
      ScrollView {
        LazyVGrid(columns: [GridItem(.flexible()), GridItem(.flexible())], spacing: DS.Spacing.large) {
            ForEach(viewModel.categories) { category in
                Text(category.title)
            }
        }
    }
  }
}

```
