# Welcome to CodeKeep! 🎉

Welcome to my personal space where I share discoveries, ideas, and lessons learned in software development. My goal is simple: to document the concepts, tools, and practices I encounter as I grow in my journey as an engineer, while creating a valuable resource for the community.  

## **Why this site?**
`CodeKeep` exists with a simple mission:
- To share tech discoveries in a straightforward and accessible way.
- To build a resource where concepts are explained clearly and simply.
- To document a continuous learning journey, even if some topics start incomplete. 

Articles are regularly updated as I grow and learn. If you notice a topic that’s missing or unfinished, feel free to reach out! Your feedback not only helps improve this site but also makes it more valuable for the entire community. `CodeKeep is a work in progress—just like my own development journey.`

## **About Me**
Hey there! I’m `Okeep`, a 24-year-old Master’s student in Software Engineering. Alongside my studies, I work as an iOS and Web Engineer, building applications and exploring new tools to craft innovative solutions.

With a passion for all things tech, my curiosity pushes me to:
- **Optimize**: Improve code efficiency and maintainability.
- **Innovate**: Experiment with fresh ideas and approaches.  
- **Share**: Document and pass on knowledge to support the community.

Though I consider myself a `beginner to intermediate engineer`, I’m always eager to contribute and grow. There’s so much to learn, and I believe sharing that journey makes us all better engineers.

Whether you’re just starting or are a seasoned pro, I hope my articles offer insights, inspiration, and maybe even spark some valuable discussions. Feel free to [reach out with feedback](/contact.md). 🚀 

## **Join the Journey**
Thank you for stopping by `CodeKeep`! This project is both a personal learning log and an open invitation to collaborate. Whether you’re here to explore new ideas, find solutions, or just feed your curiosity, I hope you enjoy your visit. Happy exploring! 🌟
