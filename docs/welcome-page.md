# Welcome to CodeKeep! 🎉

<VPTeamMembers size="small" :members="members" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"/>

This is my personal space to share discoveries, ideas, and lessons learned throughout my software development journey. My mission is simple: to document the tools, concepts, and practices I encounter as I grow as an engineer—while building a resource that’s helpful to others in the tech community.

## **Why this site?**
`CodeKeep` exists with a clear purpose:
- To share technical discoveries in a simple, accessible way.
- To build a knowledge base where concepts are explained clearly.
- To document a continuous learning journey—even if some topics begin unfinished or evolve over time.

Articles are regularly updated as I learn and grow. If you spot a missing or incomplete topic, feel free to reach out. Your input helps shape this site into something better for everyone.
**CodeKeep is a work in progress—just like the journey of becoming a better engineer.**

## **About Me**
Hi! I’m `Carolane`, or you can call me `Okeep`, a 24-year-old Master’s student in Software Engineering, currently in my final year at the University of Strasbourg (graduating March 2026). Alongside my studies, I’m also an apprentice iOS Engineer, designing and building native apps as part of my day-to-day work.

My Current Stack Includes:
* `Languages & Frameworks`: Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData, Core Data, CloudKit, Charts, Vapor
* `Architecture & Patterns`: MVVM, MVC, Clean Architecture, UserDefaults, JSON
* `Tools`: Xcode, Git (GitHub & GitLab)

I’m especially focused on writing clean, maintainable code and exploring Apple’s evolving frameworks. I enjoy experimenting with app architecture and syncing data across devices with iCloud and CloudKit.

Whether you’re just starting with iOS or have years under your belt, I hope you find something here that helps, inspires, or gets you thinking.

**Let’s keep building. Let’s keep learning. 🚀**
